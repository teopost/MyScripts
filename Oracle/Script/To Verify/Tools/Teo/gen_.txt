README for MNTCONS.EXE

This ZIP file contains two SQL*Plus scripts you can edit to taste.
Each generates 2 SQL*Plus scripts for maintainting Constraints
within the logged-into schema.


GEN_ABLE.SQL	- Generates file C:\CON_DIS.SQL to DISABLE all
		  FK, PK and UNIQUE constraints in the schem, in
		  that order.
		- Then generates file C:\CONS_EN to ENABLE all
		  the same constraints in reverse order.


	Running the first allows loading data into the schema.
	Run the second once that is done to restore the
	constraints.

	To alter tables, however, FK constraints must be dropped.


GEN_DCON.SQL	- Generates file C:\CON_DROP.SQL.  Running CON_DROP.SQL
		  DROPs all FK, then PK and UNIQUE constraints in the
		  schema.
		- Generates file C:\CON_CR.SQL, which, when run, re-creates
		  all the same constraints in revers order.  It takes a
		  long time for this return set to generate, so be patient.
		- The generated CREATEs do not include the constraints'
		  USING INDEX or EXCEPTONS INTO clauses.
