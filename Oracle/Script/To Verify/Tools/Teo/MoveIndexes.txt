   NOTE:  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!   MAKE A FULL BACKUP OF YOUR DATABASE FIRST!


   The move_indexes.sql script will handle both the regular and primary key
   indexes, including those involved in foreign key constraints.  It can move
   indexes based on index name or table name or owner for a single entity or
   using a wildcard match.  For example, using %, %, % for the index name,
   table name, and owner will move all indexes in your database except those
   owned by SYS, SYSTEM, and SCOTT.  Or, using %, %, FIMS%, all of FIMSMGR
   and FIMSARC indexes will be moved.

   The indexes tablespace must have already been created and must be of
   sufficient size to hold all of the indexes you are moving.  The command
   given below will show you the minimum size you'll need for all indexes.
   Make it bigger to allow for growth.  Also, the default storage clause for
   it should probably mirror the DEVELOPMENT tablespace, with pctincrease 1
   and maxextents 99.

      SQL> select sum(bytes) from dba_extents where segment_type = 'INDEX'
        2> and tablespace_name = 'DEVELOPMENT'
        3> and owner not in ('SYS','SYSTEM','SCOTT');

   The script took about 15 minutes to perform the moves in our case.
   After generating the SQL, it will list it out and ask you if you want
   to run that SQL.  Be sure you have a current backup before running that
   SQL, just in case something goes wrong and you have to restore!  The
   move_indexes.sql script must be run from user System.
