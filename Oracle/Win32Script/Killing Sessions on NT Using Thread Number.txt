Killing Sessions on NT Using Thread Number 

This tip comes from Loay AbuZaineh, Senior DBA at KnowledgeView, in London, UK. 

Sometimes after killing a session on NT using 

alter system kill session 'sid,serial#'  

the status of the session will be changed to KILLED and it will keep this status for a very long time before it dies.

A faster way to remove it is killing the session thread from NT itself after using the "alter system ..." command. 

First, run the following script to get the killed session thread number: 


set pagesize 100
set linesize 100
column Program format a20
SELECT  s.Sid             AS "Sid",
   s.Serial#              AS "Serial#",
   p.spid                 AS "ThreadID",
   s.OSUser               AS "OSUser",
   s.Program              AS "Program"
FROM   V$Process p, V$session s
WHERE  p.addr=s.paddr(+)
ORDER BY s.Sid

Sample Output: 

Sid Serial# ThreadID OSUser  Program
--- ------- -------- ------  -------
...
10  809     102      User01  Prog.exe
11  345     333      SeUser  App.exe  
15  719     422      User01  Prge.exe
20  345     123      SeUs    Acco.exe  
            555
            324

Then use the following command from a command prompt to remove the threads, i.e. killed session: 

"orakill  InstanceName  ThreadNumber"

example 
 
"orakill ORCL 555" 

example 

"orakill ORCL 324"
